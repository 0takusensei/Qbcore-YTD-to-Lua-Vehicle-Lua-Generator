Automatically scans through all subfolders from the script's directory, finds all .ytd files (vehicle texture dictionaries), and generates a ready-to-use output.lua file for FiveM vehicle shops (like PDM).

Each vehicle entry includes randomized brand, category, price, and a properly formatted display name â€” while preserving the original file name as the model.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Recursive search: Scans all subdirectories for .ytd files.

âœ… Preserves model name: Keeps underscores or dashes exactly as-is.

âœ… Formatted names: Converts model_name into Model Name for clean display.

âœ… Random brands & categories: Choose from your preset lists for variety.

âœ… Randomized pricing: Assigns a random price within a defined range.

âœ… One-click automation: Place the script in your base folder and run â€” no setup needed.

ðŸ“Œ Instructions
Place the batch script in your base folder containing .ytd files (or subfolders).

Double-click to run.

The script will generate output.lua in the same folder.
